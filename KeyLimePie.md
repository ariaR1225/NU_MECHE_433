## Key Lime Pie
by Aria Ruan

### Cooking time ~1hr 20mins

### Ingredients
- Sweetened condensed milk
  - This sweet, smooth, and creamy Key lime pie starts with a can of sweetened condensed milk.
- Key lime juice
  - Key lime juice comes from the Florida Keys. Key limes are more acidic than regular limes, so they pack a flavorful punch.
- Sour cream
  - Sour cream contributes to the rich texture and lends subtly tangy flavor.
- Lime zest
  - A tablespoon of lime zest enhances the bold citrusy flavor.
- Graham cracker crust

### Instructions
1. Make the filling: Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Pour into the prepared graham cracker crust.
2. Bake the pie: Bake the pie in a preheated oven until tiny bubbles appear and pop on the surface of the pie.
3. Cool the pie: Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack, then transfer it to the refrigerator to finish setting. 

*Top with whipped cream and lime wedges, if desired.*
